century it became apparent that promoting widespread and sustainable development was not
only about amounts of aid given, but also about how aid was given” 
</p>
We are pursuing beyond aid – the actual effectiveness of aid- and helping make better
relationships between donors and beneficiaries.
The BWB platform will stimulate students to read books for the actual effectiveness.
The BWB platform will operate in an innovative and transparent system that clearly shows
changes on the project site.
